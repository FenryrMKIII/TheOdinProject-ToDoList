# RestaurantApp

A minimalist web app using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bundled with webpack and managed with npm.

## Structure
- `src/` contains source files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for Copilot customization
- `.vscode/` for editor settings and tasks

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build: `npm run build`
3. Start: `npm start` (if configured)

## Customization
No frameworks. Extend with your own HTML, CSS, and JS as needed.
